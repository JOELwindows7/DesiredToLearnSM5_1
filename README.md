Desired to Learn Stepmania 5.1 Lua Script
=========================================================
Welcome to my initial Stomp free open source DLC for all Stepmania 5.1+.
I was here to start manufacturing the stuffs in SM5.1, which is a good start by now.
Everything is not perfect, because I was just a newbie for this. I was used to be in _Principia_ game Lua script.
I learn alot about those Lua scriptings, and now it's time to learn something new.
It may looks ugly at a momment. So I need your help and contribution to this.
Thank you for who helping me for preparing Stomp.
